# site_cv
The purpose of this site is to be used in a job interview by using my CV. It will retrace in four different pages my interests and qualities, my resume in a general way as well as my skills in web development rated out of 5, the main creations realized during my training at aformac and some small personal projects which aim to demonstrate my skills.
